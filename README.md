**Here i implemented**
- Write a CMakeLists.txt to compile the source files Message.hpp and Message.cpp into a library. Do not specify the type of library, shared or static, explicitly.
- Add an executable from the hello-world.cpp source file.
- Link the library into the executable.



```bash
# run commands
cmake cmake -S. -Bbuild -GNinja

```
